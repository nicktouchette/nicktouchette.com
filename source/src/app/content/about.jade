    p In an industry where technologies are consistently changing, I have devoted much time to stay relevant.  With traditional experience in Java and C++, I have shifted my focus to embrace newer stack technologies that allow for rapid development.  I have built several full-stack apps which use Node.js and Rails/Sinatra as the back-end framework, and various front-end frameworks.  Source code with a live link can be found on my Github account.
